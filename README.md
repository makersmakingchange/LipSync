# LipSync

The LipSync is a mouth-operated sip-and-puff joystick that can emulate a mouse, wireless Bluetooth mouse, or gamepad. It enables people with disabililites that limit their mobility to control a computer, gaming console, smart phone, or tablet.

This most recent version, the LipSync 4.0, is made up of the LipSync Joystick and LipSync Hub. The Joystick is the primary user interface, and contains a low-force Hall-Effect joystick and sip and puff sensors. The Hub has a display that provides a graphical interface for independently adjusting settings, as well as it provides the connection to the host device and up to three external assistive switches with 3.5 mm jacks.

The device is comprised of off-the-shelf electronics and hardware, a custom PCB and 3D printed parts. The overall cost of materials (including materials required in bulk) for a single build is about $325 (plus shipping). In larger quantities, the cost of materials is closer to $175.

The LipSync is compatible with a range of host devices that are able to support a USB Mouse, a USB Gamepad and/or a Bluetooth Mouse. Compatible devices include PC and Mac computers and laptops, Android, iOS, and Windows smartphone and tablets, and the Xbox Adaptive Controller. 

The LipSync is Open Assistive Technology (OpenAT) and is certified as Open Source Hardware by the Open Source Hardware Association under the OSHWA UID [CA000046](https://certification.oshwa.org/ca000046.html). Under the terms of the open source hardware licenses, the LipSync may be built, used, and improved by anyone.  

Older versions of the LipSync are now obsolete. Documentation and design files are still available at the [LipSync Classic Repository.](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/OldLipSync)

## Attribution

The LipSync was designed by Neil Squire Society / Makers Making Change. The initial development of a 3D printable LipSync was supported by the Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities grant from Google.org. Further development was supported through the Government of Canada's Innovation Science and Economic Development [Accessible Technology Program](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/accessible-technology-program). These and other funders have also enabled Neil Squire / Makers Making Change to deploy numerous LipSyncs to users at reduced cost.

The latest design (V4.0) incorporates feedback and suggestions from numerous users, clinicians, and volunteer makers. In particular, 4.0.AlphaII was tested by the following users: Omar Al-azawi, Don Danbrook, Ean Price, Jim Ryan and Kaileen Selig.
