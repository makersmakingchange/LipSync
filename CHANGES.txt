		- Added warning message and confirmation page
		- Added error checking, if joystick was not moved enough during full calibration, use default value instead
	- No USB auto mode switch fix
		- 4.0.1 added a feature that if no USB was detected the LipSync would automatically switch to Bluetooth mode, but this caused unintentional effects
